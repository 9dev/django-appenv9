#How it works

Creates a new reusable app schema along with demo project, git repository, virtualenv and other useful stuff.

#Usage

* Make sure to review the generated documents. You probably want to change things like app description. Look for `@todo` tags.

#Todo:

* This file
* make pypi/deploy (version=0.5)
* Additional test with a brand new project before release (after creating package)
* Enable additional arguments in appenv9
